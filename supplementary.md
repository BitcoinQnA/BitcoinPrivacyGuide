### Tor browser

[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/download/) is a web broswer that runs on the Tor network. It masks your IP address and gives you much greater online privacy. All of the tools mentioned in this guide also run natively over Tor. 

### VPN services

A VPN provides privacy by 'tunneling' your web traffic to a different server which is generally located somewhere in a different country. Whilst this does prevent your ISP from spying on your online activity, you do place some trust in the VPN server you are connecting to.
